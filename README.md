# Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning 

Tumour is formed in human body by abnormal cell multiplication in the tissue. Early detection of tumors and classifying them to Benign and malignant tumours is important in order to prevent its further growth. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique used by radiologists to study and analyse medical images. 

The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to make systems capable enough to perform such critical analysis faster with higher accuracy and efficiency levels. This research work is been done on the existing architecture of convolution neural network which can identify the tumour from MRI image.
